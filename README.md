# ToDo:
~~1) Include categories in the corr matrix [Peter]~~

2) Create a vocabulary --> create a vector w 5000 instance for each theme [Alastair]

~~3) Standardize [Peter]~~

~~4) Create baseline model [Julius, Bart]~~

5) ~~Run any classifier model of your choice on your data set,~~ and record the major metrics: accuracy, TP rate, FP rate, precision, recall, F measure, the ROC area etc [Julius, Bart]

~~6) Plot your confusion matrix and make comparisons between different evaluation metrics [Peter, Julius, Bart]~~

6) Compare between using train/test split on your data set and using cross validation [FFA]
7) Scikit-learn provides a Pipeline class for sequence of transformations. This can help you automate some experiments and test various settings. You could define your transformation pipeline to deal with missing values, attribute combination, normalization,. . . .etc [FFA]
