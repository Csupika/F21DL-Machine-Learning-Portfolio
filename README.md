# ToDo:
1) ~~Use k-means clustering to find clusters in your data set.~~ Evaluate the accuracy of this clustering, visualize the clusters.
2) try different clustering algorithms for hard and soft clustering, such as EM, GMM, hierarchical clustering or any other algorithms of your choice. Compare their performance on your data set.
3) Try also to vary the number of clusters manually. How does it affect the accuracy of clustering?
4) Research some of the existing algorithms to compute the optimal number of clusters. For example, look up: Elbow method, the silhouette method, cluster validity and similarity measures. Can these algorithms help you to find the optimal number of clusters for your data set?
5) Put all your results in a suitable form: it can be a table or a series of graphs, that visualise the variations of performance between different clustering algorithms and different numbers of clusters. 
6) Using that table (or graphs), make conclusions: What did these clustering algorithms reveal about your data set? Compare performance of clustering algorithms with the results of Bayesian classification on the same data set. Is there difference in performance?
7) Make conclusions about the optimal number of clusters for your data set.
8) Using your experiments as a source, explain all pros and cons of using different (hard and soft) clustering algorithms on the given data set.
